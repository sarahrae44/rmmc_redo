    <p>Leila is Crystal's and Jackson's daughter and she has her mama'a beautiful classic silver colors and markings. She does have a little more black running through her fur than Crystal, though. She is a gorgeous girl! She is super long and is going to be a big girl, also like her mama and she is still growing. Maine coons continue to grow until they are 3-5 years of age, so all three of my younger girls will get bigger with time. She has her mama's sweet disposition, too! She is very mellow and gentle and nothing phases her too much. Her favorite spot is on my husband's lap. Both her and Crystal are very much attached to him and seem to favor his lap over mine, which makes me extremely jealous...LOL. She does come to get her attention from me, too, though. She just seems to enjoy his lap more. I like to think that it's just because his lap is bigger and fits her better. She loves people and will accept attention from anyone who is willing to love her and pet her. She is such a sweet girl! She is still all kitten and Leila, Kona and Daisy Mae run from one end of the house to the other creating lots of chaos and we enjoy every moment of it. All of them keep us laughing at their silly antics.</p>
    <p>Leila was born on June 20, 2016, so she will be old enough to mate pretty soon here...when she at least a year old.</p>
    <p>I have also included a few of her baby pictures, so people can see what she looked like when she was little. She was super adorable...but aren't they all! One of the pics also has Pearl in the picture and another one has Kona in the picture. She is very social and is almost always hanging out with one of my other girls, if not several of them. They are truly a little family, within our family! We love them all and they are our babies.</p>
    <p>I need to get a few more current pictures of Leila. I thought I had more of them, but I can't seem to find them at the moment. I will work on that and get them added to this page as soon as I get a chance.</p>
