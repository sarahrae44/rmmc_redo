    <p>All of our kittens are CFA registered, Purebred and FeLV, FIV, HCM Negative.</p>
    <p>Pearl is Crystal's sister and she also comes to us all the way from Alabama. Pearl is a blue and cream tabby which gives her fur a softer look or hue. She's a gorgeous girl with a wonderful personality and great big golden eyes. She has beautiful blue stripes with cream undertones. She also has silvers running through her fur, which are really starting to POP, now that her full coat is coming in. She has great big fuzzy feet, just like her sister. Her mama is a warm brown tabby and her daddy is a silver tabby, so we should get some really beautiful kittens from her litters, too.</p>
    <p>Pearl is a HUGE girl! In fact, she is a little bigger than Crystal by, but does have a fatter tummy. She definitely likes to eat, but all Maine Coons do. It's  a Maine coon thing and they are growing kitties. She is super long and has a great, big, bushy tail. Pearl has wonderful lynx tips and a really nice square muzzle. Her longer nose gives her a little bit more of a wilder look, like Kahlua.</p>
    <p>Pearl is also very affectionate and absolutely loves getting attention. Both her and Crystal will go from me to my hubby and then back again, soaking up as much attention as they can get, and we are happy to oblige! Pearl aso likes to play and loves batting toys and anything else she can find around the house. They play kitty hockey together and some of my other kitties have joined them in the game. That's just a kitty thing, I think. She also like to carry her toys around in her mouth and takes them up to the top of the climbing post and stashes them there. She likes to hoard the toys and I find them in various places around the house where she likes to sleep. She's such a funny girl. She is a little bit more rambunctious than Crystal and is more of the leader of the girls, but they are almost always together or close to each other. They are definitely sisters and they seem to know it. Where Pearl goes, Crystal goes and vice versa. They are buddies. Pearl has attached herself to my husband's lap and she loves to steal his seat whenever possible. She also likes to come see me in my recliner and likes to flop over on our bed when she wants attention...in fact she insists apon it. She is also a real character. They both are. They keep us in stitches everyday and always manage to brighten our day, but what kitty doesn't...right? Maybe that's just me. LOL.</p>
    <p>Pearl will also be bred with Jackson. He is the daddy of all my kittens and he knows it. He's a proud papa and is very good about watching over the babies. He's a wonderful boy! We love him a bunch. We look forward to making many happy families with Pearl's future babies. If you are interested in one of Pearl's babies or any of our babies, Please contact us.
