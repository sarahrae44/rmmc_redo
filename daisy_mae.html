    <p>Daisy Mae is a very beautiful young calico kitty who was born on Aug. 14, 2016. She is Halley and Jackson's daughter. Daisy Mae will be a future mama when she old enough to breed. Her bough will be Aubin. He is our new male kitty who arrived her on April 22, 2017. We are so excited! The two of them should have some absolutely beautiful kittens with both of them having lots of red babies, as well as some other colors, too, of course!</p>
    <p>I have always been partial to calicos for some reason since I was a little girl. My very first kitty that I owned myself was a calico (...and I mean, not owned by my parents). She was all mine and I was so proud! I bought her when I was 16 years old and paid to have all of her shots and to get her spayed. That was my dad's conditions...being the responsible parent that he was. Her name was Little bit. I fell head over heals in love with Daisy Mae because she reminded me so much of Little Bit. Her sister is Donna Jo, Lance's kitty and when he told me what he had decided to name her, I just loved it. A soft southern name! How cool and different is that for a kitty name! So, I started looking up southern names and Daisy Mae just fit her perfectly with her beautiful reds, whites and blacks. It also fits her personality because she is just so sweet!</p>
    <p>You can really see both Jackson and Halley in Daisy Mae. She is super stocky and big for her age because she gets her size from her daddy. She also has his nice, square nose and muzzle. She gets her reds from her mama and her black and white from her Daddy. However, her Grandma on her Daddy's side of the family may have something to do with it, too, because Jackson's mama is a calico, too! She has a gorgeous tail and a nice thick coat. She also has really nice lynx tips on her ears. She's beautiful! She also has three little black spots on her little pink nose, which is also super cute!</p>
    <p>Daisy Mae really has a sweet, gentle personality and just loves attention. She is definitely a lap cap. She loves to sit on both me and my hubby's laps and when she's not in our lap, she is usually sprawled out on the bed. She is also very playful because she still a kitten afterall. One of her favorite games to play is to root around in my purse and steal whatever she can get her paws on. I find my pens, chapstick and whatever else she can find all over the house and am constantly looking for my stuff...LOL. I am trying to be quicker than her and remember to always zip my purse, but she still manages to sneak in there and takes off with little items sometimes. She thinks it's great fun. Kona, Leila, Daisy Mae and Aubin are having a ball together! The young girls are definitely very interested in the new boy in the family and he is also very interested in him! They all run around the house playing and it sounds like there's a herd of elephants stampeding during playtime. It's sure fun to watch, though. It's a little like watching high schools students when they are first discovering each other at the start of the school year...LOL.</p>
    <p>I was trying to get pics of her with her eyes open, but she managed to shut her eyes before the camera clicked every time. I think she was just messing with me. I did manage to get one with her tongue out and you will also see her mama, Halley in the picture. I have also included a couple of her baby pictures, so you can see what she looked like when she was still tiny. She was so cute, but she still is...just bigger! We just love her to pieces, but we love all of them. I do my best not to play favorites. They are all my babies and they're all special in their own way.</p>
