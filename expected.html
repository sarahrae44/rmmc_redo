    <p>Phoebe and Sammy both have babies right now. Sammy had babies on June 28, 2017. Phoebe had babies on July 3, 2017, so it has been a busy week or so.</p>
    <p>Pearl is visiting Jackson right now and I'm hoping the two of them will get together soon.</p>
    <p>Crystal's babies have just headed to their new homes within the last few weeks. She will be visiting Jackson fairly soon here.</p>
    <p>Aubin is here now and Kona and Leila are of age now. Aubin is definitely interested in the younger girls and they are interested in him, too. So, we're hoping for some more kittens to be on the way pretty soon here...once they get together. It is entirely up to the kitties, of course! They are all hanging out together right now, though. They've become really close and all of them are buddies. </p>
    <p>Daisy Mae will be of age in about another month here. She will be visiting with Aubin in the near future, too.</p>
    <p>Kahlua is retiring. She's getting older now and it's time for her to just be a kitty now. She is my special girl, so she will be staying with us. She is my oldest female kitty. She's the mama who started it all!</p>
    <p>You are welcome to put down a deposit on a future kitten, but please contact me first! The deposit is non-refundable, but it  does go towards the cost of your kitten. I charge $950.00, plus 3.9% sales tax if you live in the state of Colorado for a kitten. The deposit to reserve a kitten is $250.00 and it is non-refundable, so please make sure this is definitely what you want to do. When I receive your deposit, I will place you on my waiting list for a kitten. When I have available kittens for you, I will send pics of the kittens with a description. You can choose to take a kitten or you can choose to wait for another litter if I do not the perfect kitty for you. If you need the kitten shipped, there will be more costs involved. Please see my shipping page. I cannot guarantee the colors, sex, or how many kittens they will have, of course. However, they usually have an average of 4-7 kittens per litter.ï»¿</p>
    <p>Jackson is the papa of all of my kittens. He is very sweet and a good daddy. He helps to care for the kittens as much as he can, cleaning, playing and mothering them right along with the mama kitties. He's a sweet boy with a great personality and will pass his size and disposition onto his babies.</p>
    <p>I keep a list of people who have placed a deposit and what order I received the deposit. I have a female kitten list and a male kitten list, depending on what sex you would prefer. The people who have placed a deposit ahead of time will be contacted first, before the kittens are even advertised. Once they have chosen their kitten, the remaining available kittens will be posted on my Available Kittens page. You can put a deposit down for a kitten or make a payment through the Paypal button on the bottom of my Available Kittens Page or with your own Paypal account. You are also welcome to mail me a cashier's check. I do not accept personal checks. </p>
