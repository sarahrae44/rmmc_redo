      <h3>Samantha</h3>
      <p>Samantha is a CFA registered Pedigree Female and she is FeLV, FIV, and HCM Negative.</p>
      <p>Samantha is a classic brown tabby "Tuxedo" with low white. Samantha is a "Future Mama" and we expect her to have babies within the next six months. However, when they get together is left completely up to them! She is an incredible cat with a mischevious personality. She follows me around and chirps up a storm telling me all about it! Samantha has excellent ACA Foundation bloodlines, Champion, Grand Champion, and Grand Champion Regional Winner in her bloodlines.</p>
      <p>Samantha has a great big HUGE furry tail and walrus whiskers much like her mama, Medina of Mt. Fork Maine Coons. She has beautiful golden eyes and always looks like she's pouting, even when she's completely content and happy. She also has great big lynx tips on her ears. She has great big fuzzy white feet with lots of tuffs on them. She has beautiful markings with browns, creams and even some orange stripes running through her thick coat of fur. Samantha loves to be the center of attention and wants to help with everything! She's truly "My Buddy" and we love her!</p>
      <p>Samantha is a young female and is she is not done growing, since Maine coons continue to grow until they are 3-4 years of age. She is 2 years old now. Samantha loves her toys, kitty nip and her sleeping bag and is a very playful girl!  She also loves water and expects me to turn on the bathroom sink whenever I am in the bathroom, so she can play in it!</p>
      <p>Samantha was chosen for her size, disposition, tuxedo and for her beautiful colors. She can be very stubborn when she wants to be, but she is so adorable that you can't help love her. When she wants something, there is no stopping her and loves to be in the middle of everything. She also loves to be petted and to climb up on my bed and snuggle with me. She's a very lovey, affectionate girl and really just a sweet heart!</p>
      <p>Samantha will be paired with Jackson. However, when they breed is left entirely up to them! We expect this pairing to bring warm brown colors, cool brown colors, black and white kittens and tuxedos. She may have a few surprises in for us though!</p>
      <p>Here's a couple of pictures of Samantha as a kitten when she was 3 months old. She has always been a contankerous little thing. Well...Not so little now! She's a big girl! She loves to sit in the windows and chirps away at the birds and the squirrels. She's going to be a good mama and loves to help Kahlua mother her kittens! In the morning she climbs up next to me and kneads the blankets, going up and down my back and I'm like Aww... Kitty back massage. She is an awesome cat! If you're interested in any of Samantha's future kittens, please contact me! I'd love to hear from you!</p>
