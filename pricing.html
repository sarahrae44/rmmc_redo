    <p>At this time, we are only able to sell our kittens as pets, due to our contract with Jackson's breeder. We will to be able to sell kittens to breeders in the future, but it will be on a very selective basis. I am in the process of purchasing a second little boy who will be a future papa. Pet kittens cost $950.00, plus 3.9% sales tax if you live in the state of Colorado and can be reserved for a $250.00 non-refundable deposit. The deposit does go towards the cost of your kitten. When I receive your deposit, I will place you on my waiting list for a kitten. When I have kittens available for you, I will send you pictures of the kittens with a description and you can choose a kitten or you can choose to wait for another litter, if I don't have the right kitten for you. We do accept payments as long as the kitten is paid off within a reasonable amount of time. The cost of the kitten does include first shots, exam and de-worming. We do give a $100.00 discount if you purchase two kittens. They provide great companions for each other and it can make the transition easier for the kittens. Plus, one can never have too many Maine Coons!</p>
    <p>All Deposits/Payments are non-refundable, so please make sure it is what you want to do...for sure. I do promise that you will receive a beautiful, healthy, cuddly little kitten and it will be worth the wait.ï»¿ I do provide a health guarantee that you will receive when you receive your kitten, along with their first shot, exam and deworming information and CFA registration slip.</p>
    <p>We do ship kittens, within the United States.We will also ship a kitten internationally, if it is a flight that will not be too stressful on the kitten. Your shipping costs will be different, depending on your airport and where you live.You can ship two kittens for the same price as one. You can also contact us through our e mail at wildryno10@yahoo.com. We are concerned about the welfare of our kittens, so we do ask a few question. I'm not too nosy, though. If you are willing to tell me a little about yourself, we will then accept a deposit or payment for a kitten. Please do not send a deposit until we have had a chance to make contact with you. We accept money orders, cashiers checks, cash, or you can make a credit card payment through Pay Pal.</p>
    <p>The Pay pal button is on my available kittens page, on this website. Thank you for visiting our website and I hope you enjoy getting to know us and our kitties!</p>
