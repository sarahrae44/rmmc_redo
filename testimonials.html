    <p>We take pride in breeding world-class pedigreed cats and kittens. Please read what some of our satisfied customers have said about us and their new kitties!</p>
    <p>"I'm glad you liked the photos. I told you I'd give you updates on him! I keep my word:) His coloring is looking beautiful by the way. There is pure silver on his belly and the inside of each legs, as well as neck area. And then where he's silver on his legs there are dark gray stripes and some darker gray stripes or spots mixed in with a lot of the silver. I can tell as he gets bigger and his hair gets longer its gonna be gorgeous! I'm still feeding him the blue buffalo brand that has no by products and pure boneless free range chicken. He likes that the best for sure." - Allie</p>
    <p>"Just a quick update and a few photos.  The new baby is doing very well!  He survived his first vet appointment and received his first set of shots yesterday morning.  I have been working on a new name for him but have only managed to accrue a very long list of "maybes." He is getting along wonderfully with my other "boys" and has such a playful and loving personality." - April</p>
    <p>"My other cat is "King Vino"- I just call him Vino though.  They are so cute to watch- they chase each other all over the house and play and play and play.  I always monitor closely, but they are doing extremely well together." - April</p>
    <p>"I will be sure to tell her how accommodating you were and that you are very responsive to all of my questions, etc. Zydeco has passed all of his vet exams with flying colors-  he is a super healthy, super sweet kitty!  A treasure!!!  Thanks again!" - April</p>
    <p>"Patch is growing like a weed. He's a pretty cool cat, loves his water. Always getting up on the counter to get water. HA" - TW</p>
    <p>"I really appreciate that and you can also use me as an excellent++ reference." - Richard</p>
    <p>"I just wanted to let you know we took Webster for his second shot and checkup yesterday. Everyone at my vet fell in love with him! He's doing very well and already weighs 3.5 pounds. What a little cuddle buddy he is. He spends most evenings on my lap (when he isn't exploring). Anyway, he's doing great. Thanks for such a healthy sweet kitty!" - Diann</p>
    <p>"I bought my little Boo from you July of 2013 and I just wanted to give you a nice update! She is sooo lovey and I adore her more than life itself. She likes to wake me up in the morning and she loves to scoop her food onto the ground and eat it that way. Ha ha. I just wanted to say that she is such a goof ball and I enjoy every waking moment with her! Here are some pictures of her." - Ricci</p>
    <p>"I wanted to let you know Webster was neutered this week. He came through it fine. Here's a recent picture. He's getting really long and he is so beautiful! What a sweet boy. He follows me everywhere in the house and is such a sweetheart. Both of my other cats treat him like a baby so he gets lots of attention!" - Diann</p>
    <p>"I thought you might like a photo or two of Denali on his six-month birthday. He is as big as Sydney and continuing to grow. Thank you so much for introducing us!" - Laura</p>
    <p>"We have had Guinness for over a month now! I figured I'd send you some pictures and videos of him! He's such a playful little boy! He's decided the bath tub is a magical play place and we have to keep our bathroom door shut or else he will wake us up at 6 in the morning playing in it!﻿"" - Dani</p>
    <p>"Katsa is also my little helper and my side kick; she makes the day very special.  No worries on the second kitten and he will come to me when the time is right..  I know that you have a list of others before us and respect this as I totally put a BIG SURPRISE to you when I decided on a second baby—  we are just so happy to be part of the list you have and so happy and blessed that we get another baby from YOU!!!!!!! " - Edie</p>
    <p>"I wanted to share a “Happy Birthday to Denali!” photo so you can see what an amazing not-so-little boy he’s become.Denali is fearless - the higher the place to explore, the better. And he just adores Sydney - he blimps on top of her and they have endless mock battles that are as much fun to watch as to have, I suspect. They have bonded to the point where I actually caught them playing a game - together! - the other day. It was beyond sweet. Thank you very much for introducing us - we are so grateful for everything he’s brought to our family." - Dianne</p>
    <p>"Today is Guinness' 1st birthday!! Thought I'd send you some updates! He is 13 lbs and still growing slowly. He's turned into such a beautiful cat! And he still just loves food with all his little heart, you would think we starve him for days! He is such a clown all the time and loves causing chaos and being ornery! We've lovingly nicknamed him Guinness the Menace because of his shenanigans! One of these pictures he was under our couch (I have no idea how he fits under there) and peering out. We just got a new faux leather couch so our microfiber one is on the market and I almost feel bad selling it because he loves to paw at it and make this odd 'whoosh' sound. He's obsessed with doing that! Thank you again so much!! We just love him to death!" - Dani</p>
    <p>"Hi Jarica, how are you? Just wanted to give you a quick update on a kitty. We named him Fredrick, aka Freddy. It is a funny name for a cat, but makes him very special and unique. He is a very sweet and social boy, loves to play and chase his toys, especialy balls. I have tried to teach him to fetch, but he would just run after the ball and wait for me to throw it again rather than bringing it back. I guess I will keep training him. He is also very gentle and loves sleeping on my or my husband's lap as we work on the computer.  Also, when I cook he just sits next to me or lays on my feet. What makes me laugh the most is when Freddy wants attention, he just starts playing with my toes. I am taking him for his second round of shots and another check up this week. He already grew up at least couple inches and weighs 3.5 lbs. We have switched him to a balanced raw diet and he refuses to eat any other food now. We love Freddy a lot and he is such a wonderful addition to our family!" - Iryna</p>
    <p>"Jarica, hi, how are you? Just wanted to tell you that Sherlock was so good during the whole trip to California. He just sat between my husband and myself the whole time. He either slept or looked at the scenery outside. We didn't have to put him in his carrier. We stopped twice overnight at motels along the way, no problem with Sherlock at all. He'll meet the whole family tomorrow when we have our St Patrick dinner.﻿" - Maria</p>
    <p>"Hi Jarica-  I just wanted to send a few photos of the children to you.  After a week of slow introduction and creating a positive partnership for them, they are true buddies.  Logan follows Katsa everywhere she goes and it has been an absolute joy to watch then play.  Thank you again for completing my family and I absolutely adore and love them so much.  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!!!!" - Edie</p>
    <p>"Our baby Olive is loooooong and lean.  She loves cuddles in the morning before she takes off to check out the crows and squirrels in the windows.  A crow comes to the window and so does Olive and they just chatter away before they panic and go their separate ways! Our vet calls her, "her little ferret,"  because she's so long!" - Judith</p>
    <p>"Hi Jarica....Great news on both fronts....I'm glad your son is doing better, I hope they can give you some answers soon. Yes Eric would still like a kitty...I will let him know it may be soon :). Charlie is almost miniature schnauzer size. Him and Sophie play and wrestle all the time, then when Charlie is done he just hops up somewhere she can't reach him...lol." - Dana</p>
    <p>"Hi Jarica! I just wanted to send you a quick update on Harley, he's about to turn 1 year old next month and thought it would be a great time to let you know how well he is doing. First I have to thank you so much for providing our family with such a beautiful and loving boy. He is very much loved and is the absolute apple of my eye... I couldn't have wished for a better companion. His favorite things to do are to cuddle, play and eat! lol. He has such a great personality and has brought so much joy to our family. Anyway, I have attached a current picture of him so that you can see how big he has gotten and how gorgeous he has become. Thank you again so very much!" - Sandy</p>
    <p>"Hi Jarica, Sherlock is a sweet big baby and...spoiled. He loves his coat brushed and he enjoys being cuddled. He enjoyed the walk, he loved laying down on the warm surface of the pathway. We thought about walking him out on the street in the future, but nixed it. Seeing dogs might scare him.﻿ We anxiously await our next kitty. She will be spoiled, too.﻿ That fainting couch is Sherlock's favorite napping place. He also sleeps there at night." - Maria</p>
    <p>"Hi Jarica and I so hope you are doing well and the rest of your family are doing well.  I wanted to send you a picture of Katsa and Logan.  I cannot believe she is 1 year and 3 months and the he will be 6 months in a few weeks.  They are both doing great and they are so incredibly funny.  I laugh each day and it is so nice to have them to come home to each day.  He is an absolute love bug and has to lay right by my face and across my neck and chest every night.  They play and play and have turned out to be good buddies.  Thank you again for sending them to me as I am so blessed.  I love them more that words can say and cannot wait to see them grow and develop even more. I will keep sending photos and with this one we were playing with two wand toys I have for them and they were attacking and chasing  the spider.  Dave just caught them as they were both taking a rest. Hope you are well and happy May to you and Happy Mothers day for being a human mom and a pet mom!﻿" - Edie</p>
    <p>"Well, have we had fun!  We took a week to introduce Olive and Homer (yes, Homer) to each other and today was the first day Homer has had the run of the condo.  He is absolutely fabulous - mellow and loving and playful and curious and agile and perfect.  We are absolutely thrilled with him, but I have to tell you who appreciates him the most....you guessed it, Olive.  She is thrilled to have him.  Olive is  more relaxed and obviously happy, and very cuddly and honestly, I  feel like she looks at us and says "thank you"!  Forget separate bowls, litter boxes, or toys - they are all for one and one for all!  I must say, they both certainly sleep well - naps and all night and Olive comes in and sleeps on me for about an hour at 5:00am.  Sooo, thank you, Jarica.  We are all delighted with each other and Joel and I are so pleased with the results of taking each recommended step in introducing two kittens; it worked!" - Judith</p>
    <p>"The boys were very excited to meet their Kitty. We named her Zoey. We put her in the laundry room with all of her things when we got home (with the door open). She explored in there for quite a while and kept peaking her head around the corner at us. Once the boys were in bed she became a little braver and came out to explore. By the end of the night she was curled up on the couch with Isaac and I. She slept in the laundry room all night and is out exploring the boys this morning. I think she's going to fit in just fine :) Thank you, we adore her." - Stacey</p>
    <p>"Needless to say, we are madly in love with the little fluff ball!!!﻿ It is with great joy that we report a wonderfully successful transition for "Cameo" to her new home.  She was fine relaxing in her carrier on the ride home with just occasional tiny chirps inquiring what was going on. When we let her out in the bedroom she explored the territory (including her reflection in the mirror) and then became thoroughly engrossed in attacking the toy Mel started playing with her with for the longest time. It took her no time at all to make it to the top of her cat tower where she finally fell asleep.  When I brought her dinner a little layer she scarfed it up and then came over to thank me with much rubbing and such loud purring I wondered if it really could have come from such a tiny kitty. She napped again (still hasn't used her litter but I know she knows where it is) so we'll have to play some more before bed so she'll sleep tonight. More information than you all need, I'm sure, but we wanted to let Jarica know how well her baby is doing." - Jan</p>
    <p>"Zoey is doing really well. We are in love with her. She really has come out of her she'll now. She loves to be with the boys and snuggle on the couch with them. She is still super playful and charges around the house at full speed. Her favorite places are on the windowsill (especially if the boys are outside), under the kitchen table (she's a smart kitty) and on my husband's desk when he is working. She loves to sleep with us on our bed too." - Stacey</p>
    <p>"I wanted to update you on how Jasper is doing. He's growing like a weed and doing great. I have attached a picture of him while he was playing. His favorite thing to do play, but he is a real sweetie as well. He is growing to be a real handsome dude. This picture was taken about a week ago. I will send more as he grows." - Jennifer</p>
    <p>"Hi Jarica! Just wanted to send you couple pictures to show how big and gorgeous Freddy has become. He was neutered in July and his calm and loving nature really came out:) He is very curious about everything, always stays next to me when I work on the computer, and hates water, but, amusingly, loves to play with a little stream in the bath tub...He also fell in love with an old hamper when I was about to throw it away, now it is his favorite bed and hideaway spot...  He is a little,well not that little any more, precious friend! Hope you are doing well! I have seen the pictures of your new kitties, they are all gorgeous!" -  Iryna</p>
    <p>"Hello Jarica, I’m sending along a photo of Denali that I hope you’ll enjoy. He’s 2 today! Thank you so much for the part you played in bringing us together. He is a fantastically smart (he even learned to sit on request!), sweet-tempered little boy who has brought an amazing amount of joy into our lives. Watching him play with Sydney may be more fun for me that it is for them (although they are having a LOT of fun)! And obviously, he is stunningly beautiful; just as with my little girl, my heart melts every time I look at him. Anyway, I just wanted to take a moment to send along a note as we celebrate his day.Thank you." - Laura</p>
    <p>"These cats have stolen our hearts and are thriving. They are eating, (dry and wet cat food) drinking, using the litter box and are very playful and loving. They purr frequently when scratched behind their ears or under their chin.﻿" - Kent</p>
    <p>"It has been awhile and I wanted to update how Cynder is doing. He is growing a little bit each day and has a beautiful tail. He is the sweetest cat and fits well in our family. Again thank you enclosed is a picture of Cynder." - Jodi and Dale</p>
    <p>"Hi Jarica. Thought you might want a few pictures of Charlie. He was a little over three pounds when he got his second shot Saturday. He is getting along great with his new canine family too. And likes to "help" me work :-)﻿ I hope all is well." - Dana</p>
    <p>"Hi Jarica...just wanted to send you an updated picture of Charlie. I'm so glad I waited for him. He is perfect. Hope all is well." - Dana﻿</p>
    <p>"Hi Jarica, Zoey is very happy. She and Mila follow me everywhere I go. They both greet me when I come home. Zoey is definitely part of the family and we all love her!﻿Mila and Zoey have been playing well together since last Thursday, November 5th. Every day they increase in liking each other. They are both sleeping with us on our bed at night. Mila won't let Zoey sleep right up against her yet, but they sleep within about 4-6 inches of each other. Mila and Zoey will both sit on my lap together, but Mila will not let Zoey get right up against her on my lap yet. I don't think it will be much longer before they are curling up together and grooming each other." - Pam</p>
    <p>"Hi Jarica—I just wanted to say hello and that I hope you are well.  I wanted to send a few pictures of the kiddos to you.  Logan will be a year old next week on 11/19 and I cannot believe it; it is also hard to believe Katsa will be 2 years old in February J.  He looks smaller than Katsa in the first picture but he is actually just the same size if not a little larger.  They are great buddies and it is a lot of fun to see them play together.  They are both doing great and  there is never a dull moment, which I love about them.  Dave was changing the bed sheets yesterday and oh my, did they think that was cool diving under the sheets, under the pillows, and I have to say it took him awhile to change it as they were having tons of fun.  They are our little helpers in all that we do and bring such joy.  I hope your fall is going well and that you and your family, both two legged and 4 legged, have a great Thanksgiving.  I am so very thankful for all that I have and have to tell you am so very blessed my life path brought me to you to get my kitties—and for that I am so thankful to you as you have brought such deep joy to my life. Take care and I think of you often miss Jarica." - Edie</p>
    <p>All is well. Zoey is growing more beautiful all the time. She has a wonderful, loving personality and temperament. She really is a sweet little girl. She is constantly by my side no matter what I’m doing. ﻿Mila loves her and they have bonded well. I just picked Zoey up from the vet yesterday after being spayed. She is behaving almost as if she’d not had surgery. The vet says Zoey is a perfect Maine Coon and absolutely gorgeous. So perfect that she could have been a show cat (which I would not do anyway, but the vet was just trying to express how beautiful Zoey is). Zoey does seem to be getting more silver and white through her body coloring. It sort of looks like she’s getting that circle of silver on her side, similar to Samantha but just a different color. Her tail is blue on top and the tabby stripe underneath. This looks really cool when she walks around with her tail held high. She’s gorgeous. ﻿Hope you are doing well. After Zoey is fully recovered I will send you some updated photos. She now weighs 4.7 pounds.﻿ - Pam</p>
    <p>"Hi Jarica! ﻿Claire went to the vet last week for her second set of shots, and she's healthy as a horse. She eats like one too! She's growing so fast. Everyone loves her because you just can't help it. She's way more entertaining than Netflix! When she's done entertaining, she climbs on my lap and purrs so loud you can hear her all over the house. ﻿If she continues to be such a snuggler, I 'm thinking about getting us certified as a pet therapy team. I'm a hospice nurse, and every so often we have folks who really want to spend some time with a kitty. There are plenty of therapy dogs out there, but not many cats.I've taken her out with a harness and leash and she seems to be just fine. She loves attention! We'll see how we feel when she's a year old and eligible for certification. If she doesn't like it, we won't do it of course. Claire's in charge!" - Lori﻿</p>
    <p>"Mike and I wanted to write and tell you how well Luna Mau is doing.  She has a lovely personality and is a beautiful cat with incredible stripes.  I've attached a photo I took today of her stretched out in a chair.  She gets along great with our 15 year old Siamese cat, Toby.  We did the slow introduction keeping them apart for a month, letting them get used to each other's scents and sounds and giving Luna Mau a chance to grow a bit.  Luna Mau knows when Toby has had enough and she needs to tone down the kitten behavior. We love her. Thank you." - Sarah and Mike﻿﻿</p>"Hello! I was on your site showing people Lucy's parents &amp; t noticed you have photos from past litters up; including grown up pics. Please see attached. Priscilla is the s#*t! Intense cuddle monster &amp; mischievous like her mama Samantha. I have a harness, leash &amp; tie-up for her. She spends many of her days outside on the tip-up in the front yard. she loves it. she has made friends with the neighbors outdoor cat, Dexter. Dexter is a bit older (3-4) and off leash- Prisc is always messing with him. Prisc is never outside off leash/tie-up; cant let her get hit by a car. Personality she is an incredible sweat heart. Super playful and high energy. She love's ping pong balls. I'm looking into Air b&b'n my place and thought of the disclaimer I would use for prisc bc of her massive cuddling. She is seriously a great cat. Best I've ever had. Thank you so much! Best," - Rory</p>
    <p>"Luna Mau is doing great and is an incredible cat. She follows us everywhere in the house and loves to play mouse hockey with her toys. She also carries her toys around the house. She is scheduled for spaying next week on her 6 month birthday.﻿" - Micheal</p>
    <p>"Everyday we grow more in love with our  little girl.  Mostly we just sit around and laugh at her antics.  She sleeps all night and uses her litter box without fail.  She is perfect.  My friends want to have a kitten shower for her!!  Our dog Molly is warming up to her because really who can resist her sweetness?  Anyway I will send some pics as she gets older. Take care.﻿" - Claudia</p>
    <p>"I wanted to give you an update on Miko. I've have him for a year today and love him to pieces!! He's very very playful, a big old goofball and loves to hang out with me.﻿" - Alysha</p>
    <p>"Please feel free to use me a reference in the future, if you need to. To say Nemo is doing great, is an understatement.  Friday and Saturday he was a little shy, to be expected and tended to kind of hide, and would accept loves from us but didn't actively seek us out. By yesterday afternoon, he was coming and looking for me.. and slept in the bed with me, Sunday night, the first two nights I camped out on the floor with him. Today, if he is not eating or playing, he is either in my lap or laying right close to where I am.  He also has become fast friends with my son, they play together.  It's really cute. He has so many facial expressions and he struts around the house, like a little lion.. He is eating and drinking well, and I have him schedule to see the vet next week for a general check up and to have his 12 week shots done.  We are completely in love with him.  I know he was not the color I had originally thought I wanted, but I am so glad you emailed me about him. He is already an irreplaceable member of our family. Thanks again!" - Antonia</p>
    <p>"Hi Jarica, Since Zoey turned one on August 26th, I wanted to send you some updated pictures. She's gorgeous! She has the lynx tips on her ears. Her coloring is spectacular and it's hard to get a picture that really shows how beautiful she is and all her colors. For example, the topside of her tail is the blue-gray, but the underside is white and blue striped and looks so cool when she's walking or running. She's got a super personality and temperament. She's always by my side. We love her so much! Mila and Zoey love each other and get along great! I’ve tried to get a good picture of her standing in a way that shows her coloring, but as soon as I try, she moves! If I can get one, I’ll send it to you! Hope all is well!" - Pam</p>
    <p>"Hi Jarica-  I hope you are doing well and having a good summer so far.  I have not said hello for a while and wanted to let you know this I think of you often.  I wanted to send you a few pictures of the kiddos.  Both are doing really well and continue to fill my heart and soul with love, laughter, and companionship each moment of the day.  I purchased a Cat enclosure for them that they both love.  There is a pet door insert and they go into the enclosure from out deck sliding glass door.  I saw a feature on animal planet for Cats on Deck and was sold.  They love to be out with us and love to watch the birds and bugs.  It is so cool that I wanted to share it with you; it allows them to be outside but safe and sound in the enclosure.  I cannot believe how fast time is flying but life overall has been good and we are blessed.  I gave a woman names Sara a reference for you and told her you were phenomenal, loved your kitties and that they arrived to me healthy.  I told her that I highly recommended she go with you as you are the best.  I send my thoughts your way and am glad to know you! Take care and I will send updates to you.  I also hope you are having some special time for yourself too as you deserve it." - Edie</p>
    <p>"We have been loving having Fozzy!!  He is such a great cat!  He has a huge personality.  He loves to grab our feet when we walk by and he loves food!  He is a bit of a beggar!  Whenever we are preparing any kind of food he meows so loud for us to please give him some!  Even with his dry food out all day and twice a day feedings of wet food, he seems to always still be hungry!  Its pretty funny!  He also loves to snuggle, especially with my wife.  He has really grown attached to her. We absolutely love him!! I attached a few pictures of him!  He's growing like a weed!  When they weighed him at the vet he was already 3 pounds 3 ounces!" - Wesley</p>
    <p>"Just wanted to drop you a quick note to update you on Nemo...He is growing like a weed, and continues to charm us with his personality. He is so sweet and his favorite activity by far is snuggling. He doesn't stray far from me really, he tends to be in what ever room the family is in. He is so goofy ... he races around the house playing with toys and he flops about. He is not really much of a talker, mostly he only meows if he can't find me or the door to a room I am in is closed and he wants in.  He loves water, he has actually joined my son in the bath a couple times. And his purr is still LOUD! My husband is now home and Nemo has him wrapped around his paw.  We recently had a big event. My husband accepted a job in Virginia and Nemo travelled with us by car.  He took the trip like a rock star.   He was so good during the trip and has quickly settled in to our new home.  He is absolutely a little angel.  I can't convey enough how obvious your care and socializing if your kittens is. He is sweet,  sassy, full of energy and he is simply a joy. ﻿I have attached pictures so you can see how big he has gotten..also he is really starting to show some stripes coming through especially on his legs.  We just love him! He is a very spoiled little guy! Have a great weekend." - Antonia</p>
