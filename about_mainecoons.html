    <p>The Maine Coon is one of the oldest and largest domestic cats in the world. They have tuffs of hair on the tips of their ears, much like the linx. Maine coons inherited their name because they are from Maine, and also because their tails resemble a Raccoon tail. Many people, in the past, thought that Maine Coons were related to the Raccoon, but Science has taught us otherwise. Maine Coons can grow to be 23-25 pounds, and sometimes even larger. The females tend to be a little smaller and usually weigh between 18 and 22 pounds. A Maine Coone, named Stewie, currently holds the record for the world's largest domestic cat. He is featured in the Guinness Book of World Records and he measures in at 48.5 inches long, from the tip of his nose to the end of his tail. Maine Coons also live much longer than other breeds of cats. It is not unusual for a Maine coon to live to be 23-25 years old! Maine coons are known for their sweet, gentle, quiet personalities. Many people think that they have an almost dog-like personality, because they are very intelligent and will follow you from room to room and come when they are called. They are often called Gentle Giants or Lounge cats because of their quiet personality, which makes them a great pet for the family! You cannot find a more original, friendly, fun cat to welcome into your home. They will give you all the love and affection that you could possibly ever want or need!</p>
