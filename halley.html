    <p>Halley is a CFA registered Pedigree Female and she is FeLV, FIV, and HCM Negative.</p>
    <p>Halley comes to us all the way from Oklahoma! We are very excited to have her! Halley is three years old now. She is a Red Mackerel Tabby, which is very unusual! Usually, the Red Mackerel tabbies are males. So, to say the least, we are extremely overjoyed to be able to have a red kitty as part of our family! She is such a sweetheart with a beautiful red coat of fur! She has that wonderful Maine Coon personality that you just can't resist!</p>
    <p>We have named Halley after Halley's Comet! When she was little, she looked like a little orange ball of fur, with a tail when she went running around the house, which reminds me of a comet!</p>
    <p>Halley's beau is Jackson. He is the daddy of all my kittens. We are overjoyed to have lots of colorful little kittens to bring to families who love Maine Coons as much as we do.</p>
    <p>Halley is a little spit-fire and she knows what she wants! She is very sweet and loves to get attention. She is quite the character as you can see from the last couple of pictures on this page. She was a little younger, but it was so funny I had to share it with people. I set the crockpot on the bar and she climbed right in. So, I had to get a few pics because she had us in stitches. She's such a silly girl. She loves to sit on my lap and watches TV with us. She is definitely a lap kitty. She loves to purr and walks around the house purring up a storm. When she is getting love and attention, she purrs even louder and sounds like a little Hemi. She has the loudest purr that I have ever heard. It's just adorable and we love it! Halley follows me from room to room and wants to be near us at all times. When she can't find one of us, she meows and meows until she locates us. In the morning I wake up to whiskers tickling my nose and little paws patting me on my forhead. She's like, it's time to wake up and give me some attention, and then we cuddle and she purrs and purrs. She is so friendly, sweet and  loving! We have completely fallen in love with her!</p>
    <p>If you're interested in one of Halley's kittens, please feel free to contact me!</p>
