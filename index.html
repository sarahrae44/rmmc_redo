    <p>Welcome to our Maine Coon Cattery! We are a small cattery, located high in the beautiful Colorado Mountains. Our home sits at the foot of Mt. Evans, deep within a canyon. Idaho Springs is located about 23 miles west of Denver, Colorado. All of our cats and kittens live in our home and are also our pets. Our kittens are raised by hand and underfoot, where they get lots of love and attention, so you can be sure that they will be sociable, loving kittens.</p>
    <p>All of our adult breeding kitties are negative for FIV, FELV and tested for HCM. Our kittens come with a purchasing contract and a one year health guarantee, so you know that you will be receiving a healthy kitten. We also guarantee that the kittens have never been exposed to FIV, FELV or HCM.</p>
    <p>Our cats are registered with the Cat Fanciers Association and have Grand Champion,ACA Foundation, American Champion and European Champion bloodlines. Our kittens can be registered with both the CFA and the TICA. Our kittens are bred for their extra large size and show quality! Occasionally, we do have kittens with polydactle toes, if you like big, fuzzy feet.</p>
    <p>The total price of a kitten is $950.00, plus 3.9% sales tax if you live in the state of Colorado. We accept a $250.00 non-refundable deposit to hold a kitten and we also accept payments, as long as you can pay the kitten off within a reasonable amount of time. Once I receive your deposit, I will put you on my waiting list for a kitten. When I have available kittens for you, I will contact you with pictures and you can choose a kitten from that litter or you can choose to wait for another litter, if I don't have the right kitten for you. We will ship kittens within the United States as long as it is a flight that will not be  too stressful on your kitten.</p>
