    <p>Phoebe is a CFA registered Pedigree Female and she is FeLV, FIV, and HCM Negative.﻿﻿</p>
    <p>Phoebe is a wonderful girl and we are completely in love with her. Phoebe traveled all the way from Cowley, Wyoming with us and she is amazing! She traveled on my lap the whole way and didn't seem to mind the car at all. It was a nine hour drive, so I was impressed! She is such a mellow girl! She has a wonderful personality and really reminds me a lot of Kahlua in personality. They're both big girls with gentle personalities. She has the cutest face I've ever seen!</p>
    <p>Phoebe is a warm brown classic tabby and she is beautiful! She's a huge girl, rivaling Kahlua in size. She's HUGE...and long! We are so impressed with her beautiful silvers, reds, tans, creams and blacks. She's a gorgeous girl who also has beautiful babies! Her daddy is a beautiful brown classic named Zander that looks just like Phoebe. Her mama is a big, beautiful silver kitty, so she will have silver babies, too! She has huge feet and a beautiful plume tail!</p>
    <p>Phoebe stayed the night with us in the hotel the first night because it was such a long drive and she made herself right at home. She kicked on the bed with us and was very enthralled with the telivision. Come to find out, they don't have tv, so she had never seen it before. We thought that was funny. She is still enthralled with the television and curls up and watches it with us at night. I think we've turned her into a TV  addict! LOL. She's now made herself right at home on my bed and it seems to be her favorite spot. She is definitely a lounge cat. Phoebe is super affectionate and loves to sit on my lap and get pets. She also has a foot fetish and lays at the bottom of our recliners and gets her tummy rubbed. She loves it. She also thinks it's great fun to play with my feet at night because I like to stick them out from under the covers when I sleep. She's such a funny girl!</p>
    <p>Phoebe is best friends with all of my other kitties now and she has become part of our little kitty family. I was amazed at how well they all accepted each other at first because she wasn't a kitten any more, but Maine coons are amazing cats. They are just super mellow, easy going cats. That's why I love them so much.</p>
