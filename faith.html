    <p>My little Faith. She's my special girl! I will be posting more pics of her as she grows and changes. The first few pictures were taken when she was very tiny. The next couple of pics were taken about a month ago when she was on vacation with us.﻿ The ones with her in her new diapers were taken a week ago. So cute! She does like to travel and loves going on vacations as much as we do. She thinks it is great fun to explore the new room! One picture also has my little Pomeranian doggie in it. She's getting to be an old lady now. Her name is Lady and she is twelve years old and thinks she's a cat...LOL.</p>
    <p>WThis is Faith. She is about eight months old now. She is one of Kahlua's babies and Kahlua still mothers her. She's such a good mama! She is a smoky ﻿black special needs kitty who was born with Spina Bifida, but that doesn't stop her! She gets all over the place! She's a truly amazing kitty! My mom's a nurse and takes care of special needs people, so it's not the end of the world for us. She is truly amazing and manages to get from one end of the living room to the other in five seconds flat, but she can't use her back legs like other kitties do. She scoots with her ﻿back legs and pulls with her front legs, because her front legs work just fine. Sometimes she can manage to get her back legs underneath her and stand up a little bit. She's getting better at it all the time. She is so funny when she sits on something because she almost sits like a lady with her little back legs crossed, just like people do. Faith does spend much of her time in her new diapers, which I think are adorable. They are working wonderfully! I love the lace on her bottom and the little flower on the suspenders! So cute! It's more of a jumpsuit, so that it stays on her. They work with maxi pads and are washable. She has several different designs now. I had to wait for her to get big enough to even try, because they are actually made for puppies. She doesn't have a tail because her spine actually stops before it should, so it does not continue down to a tail, like with normal kitties. She was also born without a tail, so her little back legs connect directly to her spine. In her x rays, she looks like a little stick figure. I didn't even know kitties could be born with Spina Bifida, so this is news to me, too. She's a wonderful girl, though, and we love her. She continues to amaze us all the time with how much she just adapts to her handicap﻿, and doesn't seem to mind any of it. She doesn't even seem to mind the new diapers. She's like, "Okay Mom, put it on...I'm ready now." She does have a playpen, so she doesn't have to wear the diapers all the time, and she actually likes it. It's good sized and she knows it is hers and that's where her bed and blankie are. I will continue to post updates about her on this page, for people who are following her progress. So many people are interested in her and how she's doing! She has a little following of her own now.</p>
