    <p>This page contains information about the products that we use in our home and other tips that may help your kitten adjust to its new home. It also contains tips on keeping your new kitten happy and healthy. Some of this health advice was provided to me by Kelly of Mt. Fork Maine Coons. She is an excellent breeder and I am passing the information on because she really knows what she is doing. I consider her my unnofficial mentor. She's a registered nurse, as well as a breeder, so I really trust her advice and I follow it religiously. My mom is also a nurse and she helps to take care of my cats when I can't be here. She also helps a lot when I have health questions. Much of this information is also from my own experience raising cats, as well. I've owned cats my entire life! I just love Cats! I will add more to this page as it occurs to me.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I feed my kittens IAMS Proactive dry food, the kitten formula, in the purple bag, which is available to the kitties at all times. It's a quality cat food that doesn't break the bank. It also has more protein than a lot of other cat foods that are out there. The adult kitties get the adult formula. I also feed my kitties about a half a can of Fancy Feast wet food in the morning and then again in the evenings. The kittens may not eat it all in one sitting, so then I just put it in the fridge for next time. I just let them eat until they are full...unless it's when I'm first intoducing them to solid foods. Then, I just offer them a little at a time until they accept it. That way, they don't overeat because they've never had it before.</li>
      <li>They also get little bits of tuna, chicken and eggs for a treat from time to time. They also love their Whiskas Temptation treats, which gives them even more protein.</li>
      <li>Our Cats food and water bowls are cleaned and sanitized daily in order to make sure they are always healthy. I also suggest using stainless steel or ceramic bowls, as plastic can cause bacteria to build up.</li>
      <li>Maine Coons tend to have sensitive tummies, especially when they are kittens. If you are going to change their food, you might want to do it gradually over the first week or two. You might want to offer them some of their old food as well as the new food at first. That way, it will not mess up their digestive system, causing tummy problems.</li>
      <li>I use a combination of two different natural cat litters. Clay litters can cause serious health problems for kitties and it makes it difficult for the vet to diagnose the problem. The litter sticks to the kitty's feet and then they ingest it when they clean themselves. It clumps up inside their organs and they can't digest it. I use half Swheat Scoops and half Arm &amp; Hammer natural clumping litter. I find that Swheat Scoops clumps better, but Arm &amp; Hammer deodorizes better. They seem to work really well together, even though one of them is made out of wheat and the other one is made out of corn. We scoop our litter boxes twice a day and they are emptied, sanitized and filled with new litter once a week.</li>
      <li>You will need a couple of small cat bowls for food and water, a litter box, cat litter and a small carrier when you bring your kitten home. It is unsafe to have a kitten running around loose in your vehicle. They can get under the pedals or they could get loose. We will not replace a kitten due to it getting away from you or due to an accident. It is your responsibility to make sure your kitten gets home safely, once it is in your possession. It also wouldn't hurt to have a few toys, a bed and a scratching post as well.</li>
      <li>I suggest that when you first bring your kitten home, put them in a small room where they can find their litter box easily. You'll need to put them in the litter box once every couple of hours or as often as possible. I do have them litter box trained when they leave here, but it will be a new home, a new litter box and unfamiliar surroundings. You need to familiarize them with their new litter box. After a day or so, your kitten will find it on their own and then you can let them run around in the rest of the house, without any potty problems. I would put them in a room, like your bedroom, so that they can get to know you as well. It should be a nice quiet area so that your kitten will feel more comfortable while they get used to their new home and new people.</li>
      <li>I have also recently discovered the top feeding litter boxes and they are awesome! My cats use them just fine and they keep them from kicking litter all over the place. At first, you may want a shorter litter box, though, because it is easier for the kitten to get into until it gets bigger.</li>
      <li>We use Revolution topical to prevent parasites, such as worms, fleas and ear mites. We find that it is better to prevent the problem ahead of time, rather than to deal with the problem when it occurs. We suggest that you start the kitten on it at nine weeks of age. It is appled to the scruff of the neck of the kitty and will work for the next six weeks. Advantix II for cats also works really well and is available over the counter.</li>
      <li>You will receive your CFA blue slip and a health guarantee/purchasing contract when your kitten arrives. It protects me as the seller, you as the buyer and the welfare of the kitten. However, it is your kitten and you are welcome to make your own decisions about your kitty, as long as you are taking care of it. We will not search you down and seize your cat, as some breeders do. We think that is absolutely ridiculous. Your kitten is your kitten...not ours!</li>
      <li>If I am meeting you in person to give you your kitten, we will meet you in a public place in Idaho Springs or Evergreen. We do not allow people to come to our home, as it stresses out my mama cats, not to mention my husband. I have to respect my family's privacy. Plus.... it is just not safe to do so anymore, in this day and age.</li>
