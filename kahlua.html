    <p>Kahlua is a CFA registered Pedigree Female and she is FeLV, FIV, and HCM Negative.</p>
    <p>Kahlua is a Great Big, Beautiful Girl! She is a solid brown classic tabby with incredible markings! Kahlua has ACA Foundation bloodlines, CFA Grand Champion, Grand Champion Regional Winner, and Champion bloodlines in her pedigree. She loves to play with our other cats and is very curious. She has a very sweet, gentle personality and you can't help but to fall in love with her! She has the beautiful, large lynx tips on her ears and her looks are really impressive. Kahlua is 3 years old and is a HUGE girl! From the tip of her nose to the end of her tail, she measures 37 inches in length. She loves to get love and affection and is incredibly friendly and docile. She is definitely a lounge cat, but can be very active when she's in the mood to play. We love her size, shape and personality. She has a large, square head with a very square nose and a huge tail that looks like a giant plume! She knows she is beautiful, too, and is very proud of her tail.</p>
    <p>I love this picture because you can really see Kahlua's beautiful face and ears. She does have a very wild look to her, but she is as gentle as can be. You can really see her lynx tips in this picture. Kahlua loves to play fetch and carry objects around in her mouth. She picks up toys, milk sealing rings, paper balls and anything else that she can find. She also loves to bat things around, including balls and coins, so I have to hide my change or else it will end up all over the room! She also loves to flop over on her side and take a nap on the bed or in one of her favorite window spots. She brightens up our lives and is truly a joy to have around!</p>
    <p>Kahlua is a wonderful mama and always takes very good care of her babies. Kahlua is really the perfect cat and her physical qualities, Extra large size and personality are exactly what we want to pass onto her babies.</p>
    <p>Kahlua at 4 months of age when she was still all kitten! Even as a baby, she was an extra large girl! You can see from this photo how perfect her markings are and what a beautiful cat she really is.</p>
    <p>Kahlua's beau is Jackson of Cameo One. He is a handsome boy and the two of them grew up together. They were born three days apart from eachother, but they hail from entirely different states. Kahlua is from Oklahoma, while Jackson came to us from Montana. They sleep together, eat together and play together. They seem to know that they were meant for eachother. Their mating produces kittens of all different colors, including "great" brown classics, blue silvers, silvers, black, black with low white and even orange or calico. Jackson's mama is a beautiful calico cat, adding more colors to our babies. The above photo was taken when they were both about six months old. Both of them have grown tremendously since then!</p>
    <p>Kahlua is such a good mama that she will mother any kitten that will let her. She has become Samantha's surrogate mama ever since Samantha arrived at our home. Samantha is a full grown mama herself now, and they are not related to each other in any way. However, you wouldn't know that by looking at them! Please see her page. We hope to make many families happy with Kahlua's babies in the future. Maine Coons make excellent pets and would be a great addition for your home and family!</p>
