      <h3>Aubin</h3>
      <p>Aubin is our new little boy and he will be a future daddy when he is old enough. He arrived here on April 22nd and we are so excited to have him as the new member of our little kitty family. Aubin was born on Dec. 20th, so he's going on five months old now. He is a red silver (cameo) kitty, which is more of a bright white with light reds, and creams running through. He is a classic tabby, rather than a mackerel, so he does have the big circles on his sides, which is very cool! Right now, he is going through the long, lanky teenage kitten age, so he is all ears and feet. However, he's going to be a big boy, once he grows into his feet and ears...LOL! He's really big for his age already and he's very long and stocky. He has beautiful lynx tips and a nice square muzzle, which makes for a really wild looking kitty. I love his big, dark hazel eyes. They really stand out against his lighter colors. He has a nice, thick coat, so he will get very fluffy once his coat comes in completely. Maine coons have three coats and he's just getting his second coat in right now. He's really a beautiful boy! We are so impressed with his good looks, large size and very sweet disposition.</p>
      <p>The boy's tend to start a little younger, so it won't be too long before Aubin is old enough to mate...at about 9 months old. He will be paired with Daisy Mae, Kona and Leila, our younger girls who are up and coming mama kitties. He will also be paired with Samantha and Phoebe when he is old enough...just to throw in a little variety. We are so excited to be adding him to our breeding program.</p>
      <p>Aubin is very sweet and friendly and loves attention. He likes to curl up on my lap and next to me in my recliner. He also sleeps with me on our bed at night. I can tell he is going to be a mama's boy, which makes me very happy! He has a very deep, rumbling purr and if I didn't know better, I'd think he was related to Halley, but he's not. They come from two different breeders, in two different states. He has made himself right at home and it was a really easy transition for him and us, too. You would never even know that we just brought a new kitty into the house, which is wonderful. All of my other kitties have already accepted him and vice versa. He is all kitten still and him and Daisy Mae, Kona and Leila love to run around the house playing with each other and anything else they can get their paws on. They are creating lots of chaos, but it sure is fun to watch. They are sooo cute together!</p>
