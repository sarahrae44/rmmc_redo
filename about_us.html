    <p>I have always been fascinated with cats of all kinds, from the time that I was a child. My home wouldn't be a home unless I have a few cats hanging around.</p>
     <p>My love for Maine Coons began twelve years ago when I met my kitty, Sampson. Sampson is the gorgeous cat featured in the photos on this page. I couldn't help but fall in love with him! A friend of mine rescued Sam from an untimely demise at the local shelter and gave him to me. Sam was no spring chicken when he came to me and he passed away a few years ago. He was a wonderful friend and a great companion, providing our family with lots of love and affection throughout the years. I have never met another cat like Sam and I decided that I would like to carry on his legacy and his sweet, mellow personality. </p>
     <p>When Sam passed away, I couldn't see my life without a Maine Coon cat. I started looking for a Maine Coon kitty and soon after, I fell in love with another male Maine coon named Jackson and shortly after that, I found a beautiful female kitty named Kahlua, who I just couldn't resist! Our family of cats has been growing ever since, and I have never regretted it. My mission is to bring the joy of owning a Maine coon cat to loving families who will cherish them forever, just as I do.</p>
