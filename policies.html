    <p>We vaccinate for Feline Rhinotracheitis, Calci, Panleukopenia, and Chlamydia. We do not vaccinate for Leukemia or FIP, because research has shown that these vaccinations can actually cause these diseases. Also, the antibodies from the vaccines will remain in your cat's body, which will cause it to test positive for leukemia or FIP for the rest of its life. This can make it difficult in the future to diagnose any health problems that your cat may be having, because your kitty will always test positive for these antibodies. If your kitty is older than 12 weeks of age, it will need to have a rabies shot as well, in order for the airlines to allow them to fly. The cost of the rabies vaccination is $40.00 and is the responsibility of the buyer.</p>
    <p>We guarantee that our kittens have not been exposed to FIV, FELV, Feline AIDS, or Feline Leukemia. Our cats are never allowed to go outside or near other animals. We do not allow studs to be brought into our home, as they can bring in diseases. If any of our cats are diagnosed with a genetic defect or a disease by a certified veterinarian within the first year, which could shorten it's life span or lead to death, we will replace your kitten with a kitten of equal quality and value. We will not give you a cash refund.</p>
    <p>We do not allow potential buyers to visit our home, as they can bring in germs or diseases. We also respect our family's privacy, so we prefer to meet buyers in a public place, in Idaho Springs or Denver, Co.</p>
    <p>We also guarantee that our kittens are free of parasites, including fleas, tapeworms, round worms, and hookworms. We use Revolution ® topical once a month in order to prevent these parasites and it works great! We recommend that kittens be started on this topical treatment at 9 weeks of age, if you wish to continue these preventative methods. Mosquitoes and fleas can bring these parasites into your home, where they can infect your cats and can cause serious health risks. It will also kill ear mites, which is a big problem, if you are a cat. If a kitten is diagnosed with any of these conditions within the first ten days, by a certified veterinarian and it is related to our cattery, we will pay for the cost of treating them, minus the cost of the tests to diagnose the problem.</p>
    <p>We will give you your kittens CFA registration papers at the time that we give you your kitten. We will leave the name blank on the registration, so that you can choose your kittens permanent name. The kittens are given "baby" names while they are in our home, because it is easier to keep track of them and also for our own records.</p>
    <p>If a kitten arrives at your home and the kitten is not adjusting well, or if the kitten becomes a problem for your family, we will allow you to return the kitten to our home, within the first month. The buyer will need to pay to have it shipped back to us, and payments/deposits are non-refundable. We want our kittens to grow up in a stable, happy environment, where the situation is suitable for them and their family. If you cannot keep your kitten, and it is past the one month period, we will help you to find a new home for them. Please do not take the kitten to a shelter!</p>
    <p>We do ask that our potential buyers tell us a little about themselves. We are concerned about the future health and happiness of our kittens in their new homes. We just want to be sure that our kittens will be well taken care of in the future. Once you are approved, we will contact you and then you can send a deposit or payment towards a kitten, if you wish.</p>
    <p>Our kittens are usually ready to be weaned and go to their new homes when they are 10-12 weeks of age, but we leave it up to them. Once the mama cats have weaned them completely, they will be ready to go to their new home.</p>
    <p>We will hold a kitten until it is 12 weeks of age. If a kittens is not paid for by the time it is 12 weeks of age, it will be advertized and sold to another person for a new home. If you need us to hold the kitten for longer than twelve weeks, there will be an additional $25.00 boarding fee, per week. We will hold the kitten for no longer than sixteen weeks.There are many expenses required in order for us to care for these kittens and the$25.00 boarding fee helps us to cover those expenses.</p>
    <p>The total Price of a kitten is $950.00, plus 3.9% sales tax if you live in the state of Colorado. We accept a $250.00 non-refundable Deposit to reserve a kitten. Your deposit will go towards the price of the kitten. The first person who places a deposit will get the first choice of kittens. The second person will get the second choice...and so on. That's the only fair way that I have been able to figure out to do this. When the kittens are eight weeks old and have had their first exam, I will start to notify anybody who has placed a deposit with me and let them know what kittens we have available. If we do not have a kitten that is the color and sex that you want, you are always welcome to wait for my next litter.﻿ All Deposits/Payments are non-refundable, so please make sure it is what you want to do... for sure. I do promise that you will receive a beautiful, cuddly little kitten and it will be worth the wait.﻿ I do promise that you will receive a beautiful, healthy, cuddly little kitten and it will be worth the wait.﻿ I do provide a health guarantee that you will receive when you receive your kitten, along with their first shot, exam and deworming information and CFA registration slip.﻿</p>
    <p>We can meet a buyer part-way if it's not too far and it works out for everyone. ﻿﻿We will meet you in a public place if you are going to pick up the kitten. However, I am starting to charge $25.00 for each hour that I am actually on the road. That money goes to pay for my gas, time and wear and tear on our vehicle. I don't charge for the time once I arrive. It is only for the time that I am actually driving. If it is less than an hour, it will be rounded up to the next hour and there is a minimum of one hour charged. If you are willing to meet me in Idaho Springs than I don't charge anything, of course. It's just that, lately, I have found myself driving to meet people a lot and it does take a good deal of time and energy and gas is not cheap.</p>
