          <h3>Policies</h3>
          <p>We vaccinate for Feline Rhinotracheitis, Calci, Panleukopenia, and Chlamydia. We do not vaccinate for Leukemia or FIP, because research has shown that these vaccinations can actually cause these diseases. Also, the antibodies from the vaccines will remain in your cat's body, which will cause it to test positive for leukemia or FIP for the rest of its life. This can make it difficult in the future to diagnose any health problems that your cat may be having, because your kitty will always test positive for these antibodies. If your kitty is older than 12 weeks of age, it will need to have a rabies shot as well, in order for the airlines to allow them to fly. The cost of the rabies vaccination is $40.00 and is the responsibility of the buyer.</p>
          <p>We guarantee that our kittens have not been exposed to FIV, FELV, Feline AIDS, or Feline Leukemia. Our cats are never allowed to go outside or near other animals. We do not allow studs to be brought into our home, as they can bring in diseases. If any of our cats are diagnosed with a genetic defect or a disease by a certified veterinarian within the first year, which could shorten it's life span or lead to death, we will replace your kitten with a kitten of equal quality and value. We will not give you a cash refund.</p>
          <p>We do not allow potential buyers to visit our home, as they can bring in germs or diseases. We also respect our family's privacy, so we prefer to meet buyers in a public place, in Idaho Springs or Denver, Co.</p>
          <p>We also guarantee that our kittens are free of parasites, including fleas, tapeworms, round worms, and hookworms. We use Revolution ® topical once a month in order to prevent these parasites and it works great! We recommend that kittens be started on this topical treatment at 9 weeks of age, if you wish to continue these preventative methods. Mosquitoes and fleas can bring these parasites into your home, where they can infect your cats and can cause serious health risks. It will also kill ear mites, which is a big problem, if you are a cat. If a kitten is diagnosed with any of these conditions within the first ten days, by a certified veterinarian and it is related to our cattery, we will pay for the cost of treating them, minus the cost of the tests to diagnose the problem.</p>
          <p>We will give you your kittens CFA registration papers at the time that we give you your kitten. We will leave the name blank on the registration, so that you can choose your kittens permanent name. The kittens are given "baby" names while they are in our home, because it is easier to keep track of them and also for our own records.</p>
          <p>If a kitten arrives at your home and the kitten is not adjusting well, or if the kitten becomes a problem for your family, we will allow you to return the kitten to our home, within the first month. The buyer will need to pay to have it shipped back to us, and payments/deposits are non-refundable. We want our kittens to grow up in a stable, happy environment, where the situation is suitable for them and their family. If you cannot keep your kitten, and it is past the one month period, we will help you to find a new home for them. Please do not take the kitten to a shelter!</p>
          <p>We do ask that our potential buyers tell us a little about themselves. We are concerned about the future health and happiness of our kittens in their new homes. We just want to be sure that our kittens will be well taken care of in the future. Once you are approved, we will contact you and then you can send a deposit or payment towards a kitten, if you wish.</p>
          <p>Our kittens are usually ready to be weaned and go to their new homes when they are 10-12 weeks of age, but we leave it up to them. Once the mama cats have weaned them completely, they will be ready to go to their new home.</p>
          <p>We will hold a kitten until it is 12 weeks of age. If a kittens is not paid for by the time it is 12 weeks of age, it will be advertized and sold to another person for a new home. If you need us to hold the kitten for longer than twelve weeks, there will be an additional $25.00 boarding fee, per week. We will hold the kitten for no longer than sixteen weeks.There are many expenses required in order for us to care for these kittens and the$25.00 boarding fee helps us to cover those expenses.</p>
          <p>The total Price of a kitten is $950.00, plus 3.9% sales tax if you live in the state of Colorado. We accept a $250.00 non-refundable Deposit to reserve a kitten. Your deposit will go towards the price of the kitten. The first person who places a deposit will get the first choice of kittens. The second person will get the second choice...and so on. That's the only fair way that I have been able to figure out to do this. When the kittens are eight weeks old and have had their first exam, I will start to notify anybody who has placed a deposit with me and let them know what kittens we have available. If we do not have a kitten that is the color and sex that you want, you are always welcome to wait for my next litter.﻿ All Deposits/Payments are non-refundable, so please make sure it is what you want to do... for sure. I do promise that you will receive a beautiful, cuddly little kitten and it will be worth the wait.﻿ I do promise that you will receive a beautiful, healthy, cuddly little kitten and it will be worth the wait.﻿ I do provide a health guarantee that you will receive when you receive your kitten, along with their first shot, exam and deworming information and CFA registration slip.﻿</p>
          <p>We can meet a buyer part-way if it's not too far and it works out for everyone. ﻿﻿We will meet you in a public place if you are going to pick up the kitten. However, I am starting to charge $25.00 for each hour that I am actually on the road. That money goes to pay for my gas, time and wear and tear on our vehicle. I don't charge for the time once I arrive. It is only for the time that I am actually driving. If it is less than an hour, it will be rounded up to the next hour and there is a minimum of one hour charged. If you are willing to meet me in Idaho Springs than I don't charge anything, of course. It's just that, lately, I have found myself driving to meet people a lot and it does take a good deal of time and energy and gas is not cheap.</p>

          <h3>Pricing</h3>
          <p>At this time, we are only able to sell our kittens as pets, due to our contract with Jackson's breeder. We will to be able to sell kittens to breeders in the future, but it will be on a very selective basis. I am in the process of purchasing a second little boy who will be a future papa. Pet kittens cost $950.00, plus 3.9% sales tax if you live in the state of Colorado and can be reserved for a $250.00 non-refundable deposit. The deposit does go towards the cost of your kitten. When I receive your deposit, I will place you on my waiting list for a kitten. When I have kittens available for you, I will send you pictures of the kittens with a description and you can choose a kitten or you can choose to wait for another litter, if I don't have the right kitten for you. We do accept payments as long as the kitten is paid off within a reasonable amount of time. The cost of the kitten does include first shots, exam and de-worming. We do give a $100.00 discount if you purchase two kittens. They provide great companions for each other and it can make the transition easier for the kittens. Plus, one can never have too many Maine Coons!</p>
          <p>All Deposits/Payments are non-refundable, so please make sure it is what you want to do...for sure. I do promise that you will receive a beautiful, healthy, cuddly little kitten and it will be worth the wait.﻿ I do provide a health guarantee that you will receive when you receive your kitten, along with their first shot, exam and deworming information and CFA registration slip.</p>
          <p>We do ship kittens, within the United States.We will also ship a kitten internationally, if it is a flight that will not be too stressful on the kitten. Your shipping costs will be different, depending on your airport and where you live.You can ship two kittens for the same price as one. You can also contact us through our e mail at wildryno10@yahoo.com. We are concerned about the welfare of our kittens, so we do ask a few question. I'm not too nosy, though. If you are willing to tell me a little about yourself, we will then accept a deposit or payment for a kitten. Please do not send a deposit until we have had a chance to make contact with you. We accept money orders, cashiers checks, cash, or you can make a credit card payment through Pay Pal.</p>
          <p>The Pay pal button is on my available kittens page, on this website. Thank you for visiting our website and I hope you enjoy getting to know us and our kitties!</p>

          <h3>Shipping</h3>
          <p>Our kittens are shipped out of Denver International Airport and the cost of shipping is usually between $289.00 and $350.00, within the United States. The cost can vary depending on your airport, and where you are located. I will contact the airport and give you an exact cost on shipping, once I find out where the kittens will be shipped to. My  driver charges $250.00 for the four-hour round trip to the airport and the gas to get the kitten to the airport. Much of the time it ends up being more than four hours due to sitting in traffic trying to get all the way through Denver. Plus, the kittens have to be there two hours ahead of time, so it does take a full day to get there, check them in and get home again. Not to mention, making all the arrangements with the airlines and going to the vet an extra time to get the health certificate. The airline approved carrier costs $60.00 -75.00, depending on the size.</p>
          <p>The health certificate costs $90.00 and the rabies vaccination is an additional $50.00, if the kitten is going to need to be shipped to you. I will only need to get a rabies shot if the kitten is older than four months. The airport requires it.</p>
          <p>No kittens will be shipped until we have received payment for these charges and the cost of the kitten. Deposits and payments made on kittens are non-refundable. We accept cash, money orders, cashier's checks and credit card payments, made through Pay Pal. Pay Pal does charge a 4% transaction fee, which will be charged to the buyer.</p>
          <p>Flying cats on airlines is usually very safe. However, if for some reason your kitten gets sick or dies due to something that happens on the airplane or at the airport, we will not be held responsible. Once the kitten leaves our care, it is the responsibility of the airline to deliver the kittens safely. We do purchase insurance that covers the cost of the kitten through the airline, when the kitten is shipped. However, the buyer would need to file a claim with the airport's insurance company if anything unforseen should happen, during the flight.</p>
