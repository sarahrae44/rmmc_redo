      <h3>Shipping</h3>
      <p>Our kittens are shipped out of Denver International Airport and the cost of shipping is usually between $289.00 and $350.00, within the United States. The cost can vary depending on your airport, and where you are located. I will contact the airport and give you an exact cost on shipping, once I find out where the kittens will be shipped to. My  driver charges $250.00 for the four-hour round trip to the airport and the gas to get the kitten to the airport. Much of the time it ends up being more than four hours due to sitting in traffic trying to get all the way through Denver. Plus, the kittens have to be there two hours ahead of time, so it does take a full day to get there, check them in and get home again. Not to mention, making all the arrangements with the airlines and going to the vet an extra time to get the health certificate. The airline approved carrier costs $60.00 -75.00, depending on the size.</p>
      <p>The health certificate costs $90.00 and the rabies vaccination is an additional $50.00, if the kitten is going to need to be shipped to you. I will only need to get a rabies shot if the kitten is older than four months. The airport requires it.</p>
      <p>No kittens will be shipped until we have received payment for these charges and the cost of the kitten. Deposits and payments made on kittens are non-refundable. We accept cash, money orders, cashier's checks and credit card payments, made through Pay Pal. Pay Pal does charge a 4% transaction fee, which will be charged to the buyer.</p>
      <p>Flying cats on airlines is usually very safe. However, if for some reason your kitten gets sick or dies due to something that happens on the airplane or at the airport, we will not be held responsible. Once the kitten leaves our care, it is the responsibility of the airline to deliver the kittens safely. We do purchase insurance that covers the cost of the kitten through the airline, when the kitten is shipped. However, the buyer would need to file a claim with the airport's insurance company if anything unforseen should happen, during the flight.</p>
