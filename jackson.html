      <h3>Jackson</h3>
      <p>Jackson is a CFA registered Pedigree Male and he is FeLV, FIV, and HCM Negative.</p>
      <p>Jackson is a HUGE beautiful boy and Gentle Giant describes him perfectly. Jackson has excellent American Champion bloodlines and some very old lineage on his mother's side. Jackson is CFA registered and pedigreed. Jackson is one and a half years old and weighs 21 pounds! He will continue to grow until he is 3-4 years old.</p>
      <p>Jackson is as gentle as can be and extremely affectionate. He loves attention and starts talking to me whenever he sees me walk into a room. Jackson has big beautiful golden eyes and a huge square head and nose! He also has giant feet and is just a really big, stocky boy. He has a super long fluffy tail and is really an awesome cat.</p>
      <p>Jackson loves to lounge in high places and keeps an eye on everybody in the house, including our girls and babies. He is my watch kitty, but he wouldn't hurt a flea. When Jackson is not lounging around the house, he loves to play with Kahlua and Samantha and they go running back and forth across the house, creating lots of chaos. We enjoy every minute of it, though. It's just so funny to watch! He loves to bat toys and anything he can find around the house and plays kitty hockey in the kitchen.</p>
      <p>The picure of Jackson on the striped bedspread is a picture of Jackson when he was just four months old. He was a big boy, even as a kitten. Jackson has excellent lynx tipped ears is such a mellow boy! He has a very clownish personality, which is typical of male Maine Coons. The females tend to have a little more dignity. He makes us laugh all of the time with his silly antics. We are very proud to be passing on his excellent bloodlines, pedigree and personality to his kittens.</p>
      <p>Jackson is an excellent daddy and helps Kahlua mother the kittens. He also plays with the kittens, but he is never too rough. He seems to know that they're babies and so he has to be gentle. He's extremely intelligent and we feel extremely blessed to have him in our lives. He's just really a sweet, loving kitty!</p>
