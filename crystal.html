    <p>All of our kittens are CFA registered, Purebred and FeLV, FIV, HCM Negative.ï»¿</p>
    <p>Crystal has arrived all the way from Alabama and we are so happy to have her! Crystal is a beautiful silver classic tabby. Crystal has beautiful markings and she almost looks like a snow leopard. Her silvers are really starting to pop now that her full coat is coming in! We love her size, shape and personality. Her Daddy is also a classic silver tabby and her mama is a warm brown tabby. Her sister, Pearl is a blue and cream tabby, so we should get lots of silver tabbies, brown tabbies and blue or blue tabby kittens, along with some other colors, of course, from her litters.</p>
    <p>Crystal is a very sweet, gentle and mellow girl for her age. She still likes to play, because she is still all kitten, but she's super easy going for a kitty her age. Crystal loves to sit on the back of my recliner and in my lap. She is definitely a lap kitty. She also loves to flop over on her side on the bed with me when she wants love and attention. She also likes to keep me company when I cook. She likes to be involved and help with everything I do. She is definitely my side kick!</p>
    <p>Crystal is Pearl's sister and we have been very impressed with both of them ever since they arrived. Crystal is a big girl and she is also super long. She has a nice square muzzle and great big, beautiful, golden eyes. She also has a great big fluffy tail and the biggest feet you've ever seen! So funny! She is super intelligent and loves to carry things around in her mouth. She will also carry off anything that is not nailed down and bat it around the house and she loves playing kitty hockey!</p>
    <p>Crystal is definitely a character. She is such a funny girl! She cracks us up all the time with her antics. She does this one thing where she will lay on the climbing post or a table and hang her legs off the side and then she moves moves both legs up and down simultaneously, like she's dribbling an invisible basketball. I have a video of her doing it if you would like to see it, but you'll have to email me, because Yahoo small business doesn't let me add video. It's the funniest thing you've ever seen and nobody knows why she does it. I've never seen a cat do this, but it's hysterical to watch.</p>
    <p>Crystal will be bred with Jackson. He is the daddy of all my kittens and he thinks he's King Tut around here! We are also looking into bringing a second male into our breeding program in the future. We look forward to making many happy families with Crystal's future babies. If you are interested in one of Crystal's babies or any of our babies, Please contact us. My contact information is listed below and you can also contact us through our Contact US! page.</p>
