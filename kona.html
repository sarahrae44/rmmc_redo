    <p>This is Kona. She is Halley and Jackson's daughter. She is a beautiul solid brown mackerel tabby, but she does have more reds in her coat because her mama is red. She has a very sweet, gentle personality and is very sensitive to what's going on with both her people family and her kitty family. She is super loving and affectionate and insists on getting her attention on my lap on a very regular basis. In fact, if it were up to her, I don't think she'd ever leave my lap...LOL. She sleeps on my pillow every night. Luckily I'm used to waking up surrounded by kitties!</p>
    <p>Kona is a young female who will be a future mama. She will be old enough to mate when she is one year old. She was born on May 1, 2016. Her beau will be Aubin. He is our new male kitty who will be arriving on April 22nd. We are so excited! She is long and beautiful with a gorgeous tail, nice lynx tips and a nice square muzzle, just like her mama. In fact, other than her colors, she looks just like her mama and she has her mama's temperament, too. She does have her mama's loud purr and she also purrs like a hemi! It's loud and she purrs A lot...like all the time. I love their little purrs! Halley, Daisy Mae and Kona all give kisses, which is also very adorable.</p>
    <p>As you can see she is all kitten still even though she's turning into a big girl. I have also included a couple of baby pictures, so you can see what she looked like when she was tiny. She was such a cute kitten, but she's still pretty cute now! She's a real sweetheart and she's my girl. We love her bunches. Kona, Leila and Daisy Mae are all very close, since they were raised together even though they are all from different litters. Daisy Mae is her sibling because they have the same mama, but were born at different times.ï»¿</p>
